Today we kick off a three-part build where I turn four 4.5 kW water-heater elements, beefy 60 A SSRs, and an Arduino brain into a 20 kilowatt resistive load bank. Why? To hammer my off-grid inverters with real-world power, chart their efficiency curves, and expose weak links if any.

Episode roadmap

1Ô∏è‚É£ Concept & parts haul ‚Äì heater math, safety rules, un-boxing SSR-60-DA monsters

2Ô∏è‚É£ Control electronics ‚Äì zero-cross detector, burst-fire code, current logging on an Arduino UNO

3Ô∏è‚É£ Mechanical build ‚Äì submerged elements, fan-cooled heat-sinks, 100 A breaker panel

4Ô∏è‚É£ Full-power torture test ‚Äì 20 kW soak, live data, thermal cam footage, results!

What you‚Äôll learn
‚Ä¢ Sizing resistive loads for 220 VAC
‚Ä¢ Using solid-state relays for step + PWM control
‚Ä¢ Building safe mains enclosures (fuses, contactors, Earth bonding)
‚Ä¢ Capturing efficiency data and plotting it with free tools

‚ö†Ô∏è MAINS VOLTAGES CAN KILL ‚Äì follow local electrical codes, use proper PPE, and never work live alone.
